## Segment 1: Hero Introduction

**First Frame:**
Dark, modern dashboard interface. The Vibe Anywhere logo prominently displayed in the top-left corner. A three-panel layout visible: left sidebar showing a tree of repositories with nested workspaces, center showing a tab bar with multiple terminal tabs, right showing a full-screen terminal with a blinking cursor. Green "Connected" status badge visible. The terminal shows a welcome message and prompt ready for input.

**Video Content:**
Camera slowly zooms into the dashboard. Text overlay fades in: "Your AI coding sessions. Always running." The cursor in the terminal starts typing a command. Multiple workspace indicators pulse subtly in the sidebar, suggesting active parallel sessions. The connection status badge glows green, emphasizing the real-time nature.

## Segment 2: Multi-Workspace Overview

**First Frame:**
Dashboard sidebar expanded, showing three repositories with multiple workspaces nested under each. Each workspace shows a colored status indicator (green for running, yellow for starting). Branch names visible next to each workspace (e.g., "feature/auth", "bugfix/login", "main"). The selected workspace is highlighted.

**Video Content:**
Mouse cursor clicks through different workspaces in the sidebar. Each click instantly switches the main terminal view, showing different code/terminal states for each workspace. Quick transitions demonstrate that each workspace maintains its own isolated state. Text overlay: "Parallel isolated sessions. Zero conflicts."

## Segment 3: Terminal Power

**First Frame:**
Full-screen terminal view with JetBrains Mono font. A complex command output visible - perhaps a test suite running with colored pass/fail indicators. Green checkmarks and syntax-highlighted output. The terminal background is sleek dark theme.

**Video Content:**
Live terminal action: A developer runs `npm test` and results stream in real-time. Green checkmarks appear for passing tests. Then the user runs `git status` showing modified files in red/green colors. A quick resize of the terminal window shows smooth responsive behavior. Text overlay: "Real-time. Responsive. Professional."

## Segment 4: Split-View Magic

**First Frame:**
Terminal split into a 2x2 grid layout showing four different terminal sessions. Top-left runs a dev server with live logs, top-right shows a test watcher, bottom-left displays git diff output with green/red highlighting, bottom-right shows an AI assistant conversation. Each pane has its own tab label.

**Video Content:**
The user right-clicks on a tab, context menu appears with "Split" option. They select "2x2 Grid". The screen smoothly animates into four panes. Each pane shows different activity happening simultaneously. The user drags a divider to resize panes. Text overlay: "Work on four things at once."

---

## Segment 5: Git Integration

**First Frame:**
Split view with terminal on the left and Git diff viewer on the right. The diff shows a code file with green lines (additions) and red lines (deletions). File name header visible at top. The diff has syntax highlighting matching the code language.

**Video Content:**
User types code changes in the terminal (using vim or nano). The git diff panel on the right updates in real-time showing the new changes. Green highlighted lines appear as code is added. User then runs `git add .` and `git commit -m "Add feature"` - commit success message appears. Text overlay: "See changes. Commit instantly."

---

## Segment 6: Workspace Creation

**First Frame:**
"Create Workspace" modal dialog open over the dashboard. Form fields visible: workspace name input, branch dropdown (showing filtered list like "main", "develop", "feature/*"), template selection. Clean, modern form design with rounded inputs.

**Video Content:**
User types a workspace name. Branch dropdown opens with type-to-filter functionality - they type "feat" and the list filters to feature branches. They select "feature/new-api". Click "Create" button. Progress indicator appears. The sidebar animates to show the new workspace appearing with a yellow "Starting" status that transitions to green "Running". Text overlay: "Deploy in seconds."

---

## Segment 7: Container Status Dashboard

**First Frame:**
Dashboard panel view showing workspace details. Cards display: Agent Status (green "Connected" with version number), Container Info (VMID, IP address like "192.168.3.45", Status: "Running"), Template Info (template name, inherited tech stacks listed). Action buttons visible: Restart, Shutdown, Redeploy.

**Video Content:**
The agent status card shows a heartbeat timestamp updating in real-time. User clicks "Restart" button - confirmation dialog appears with warning message. They confirm. The container status changes to "Restarting" with a spinner, then back to "Running" with a new uptime counter. The terminal reconnects automatically. Text overlay: "Full control. Zero SSH."

---

## Segment 8: Persistence Demo

**First Frame:**
Browser window showing Vibe Anywhere with multiple tabs open, terminal with command history visible, sidebar with workspace selected. A cursor hovers over the browser's X (close) button.

**Video Content:**
User clicks the browser close button - window disappears to black. Beat of 2 seconds. Browser reopens, navigates to Vibe Anywhere. The dashboard loads and shows EXACTLY the same state: same tabs, same workspace selected, same terminal content including the command history. The terminal cursor blinks ready. Text overlay: "Close your laptop. Come back anytime."

---

## Segment 9: Tech Stack Selection

**First Frame:**
Template configuration screen showing available tech stacks as selectable cards/chips. Visible options include: Node.js (with version), Python, Claude Code CLI, GitHub CLI, Rust, Go. Some are checked/selected with checkmarks. Icons represent each technology.

**Video Content:**
User clicks through selecting tech stacks: Node.js (click, checkmark appears), Claude Code (click, checkmark). A staging terminal opens showing the installation progress - package downloads and installation logs scroll by. Installation completes with success message. Text overlay: "Pre-configured. Ready to code."

---

## Segment 10: The Big Picture

**First Frame:**
Zoomed-out view of the full Vibe Anywhere interface. Left sidebar shows multiple repositories each with multiple workspaces (total of 8-10 workspaces visible). Some show green running status, others yellow starting. The main view shows a 2x2 split with different activities. Connection badge shows "Connected". Modern, professional dark theme throughout.

**Video Content:**
Quick montage: Cursor flies between workspaces showing different projects. Split views activate and deactivate. Terminals execute commands. Git diffs appear and disappear. Everything is fast, responsive, seamless. Final zoom out to show the entire dashboard with all parallel sessions running. Text overlay fades in: "Vibe Anywhere" followed by tagline "Your coding sessions. Always running." and website URL.
