# Real-time Operations Skill

This skill automatically triggers the realtime-integration agent when you work on real-time features.

## When This Triggers

- WebSocket server setup

- Namespace management (main, /agent)
- State broadcasting patterns
- Tailscale auth key generation
- CDP proxy implementation
- Graceful reconnection
